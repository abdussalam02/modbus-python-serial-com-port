Python codes - connect to a serial modbus devices to fetch data from list of slave machines.<br>
Connect to a TCP/IP modbus devices to fetch data from list of slave machines.<br>
Also using Python Brutforce Different Configuration of modbus/serial devices as follows <br>
   Baudrate [2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 2800, 38400, 57600, 76800, 115200, 230400],<br>
   List of Slave Devices (1 to 247),<br>
   parity_list [ "N", "O", "E" ],<br>
   stopbits_list [ 0, 1, 2 ],<br>
   connection method [ "rtu", "ascii", "binary" ],<br>

Use Network extender or connect the modbus devices to serial or TCP/IP </br>
Send the data to server over API </br>
I've attached PHP API reference file <br>
